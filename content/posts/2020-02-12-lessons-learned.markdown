## Day trading and lessons learned

![BTC-2020-02-12](/img/STX_20200212215426.jpg)

In order to increase fund utilization, today I tried day trading and felt sucks for my operation. It's quite different from what I usually do. it's more vulnerable and having less time to think. Need to enter when chance come and get out when wrong immediately.  
Yellow line shows where I get in and out. It's obvious not right to hold so long during day trading and no operation when finding enter the wrong position.  
Anyway I will keep day trading. I will get here and mark down if I make the same mistake in future.
