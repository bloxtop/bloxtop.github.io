      <description>BTC long trade 2 Previously on BTC long trade: It has broken the resistance strongly. Long opportunity may continue after a pullback in near future. It seems have gone the way as we expected. It raised to 9553 on 2020/01/31 and pullback to 9088 on 2020/02/05, then raised again(long opportunity).
Next step Now BTC is testing 9552, another wave is around the corner if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t break the support. I&amp;rsquo;m still bullish about future.</description>
