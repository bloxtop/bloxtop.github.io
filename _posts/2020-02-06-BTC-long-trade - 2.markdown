## BTC long trade 2

![BTC-2020-02-06]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/BTC-2020-02-06.png)

#### Previously on BTC long trade:
*It has broken the resistance strongly. Long opportunity may continue after a pullback in near future.*
It seems have gone the way as we expected. It raised to 9553 on 2020/01/31 and pullback to 9088 on 2020/02/05, then raised again(long opportunity).

#### Next step
Now BTC is testing 9552, another wave is around the corner if it doesn't break the support. I'm still bullish about future. Ladies and gentelmen, let's HODL.
