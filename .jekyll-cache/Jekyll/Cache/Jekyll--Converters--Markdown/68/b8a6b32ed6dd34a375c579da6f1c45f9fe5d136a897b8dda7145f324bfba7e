<p>In order to increase fund utilization, today I tried day trading and felt sucks for my operation. Itâ€™s quite different from what I usually do. itâ€™s more vulnerable and having less time to think. Need to enter when chance come and get out when wrong immediately. Anyway I will keep day trading. I will get here and mark down if I make the same mistake in future.</p>
