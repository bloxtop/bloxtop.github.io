<p>In order to increase fund utilization, today I tried day trading and felt sucks for my operation. It’s quite different from what I usually do. it’s more vulnerable and having less time to think. Need to enter when chance come and get out when wrong immediately.<br />
Yellow line shows where I get in and out. It’s obvious not right to hold so long during day trading and no operation when finding enter the wrong position.<br />
Anyway I will keep day trading. I will get here and mark down if I make the same mistake in future.</p>
