<p>Previously on BTC long trade:
<em>It has broken the resistance strongly. Long opportunity may continue after a pullback in near future.</em> It seems have gone the way as we expected. It raised to 9553 on 2020/01/31 and pullback to 9088 on 2020/02/05, then raised again(long opportunity).
Now BTC is testing 9552, another wave is around the corner if it doesn’t break the support. I’m still bullish about future. Ladies and gentelmen, let’s HODL.</p>
