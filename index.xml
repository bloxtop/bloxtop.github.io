      <description>Market is full of emotions: fear, greed, hesitation, etc. Trading is about how to dealing with emotions. And usually, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to settle well, because we human are emotional animals. Here are emotions we may face during bear and bull market.
   * Bear Bull     Buy Too fear to buy Greed and buy on top   Sell fear and sell on bottom Too greed to sell    So we need a operating manual or methodology to help us settle emotions during trading.</description>

      <description>Day trading and lessons learned order to increase fund utilization, today I tried day trading and felt sucks for my operation. It&amp;rsquo;s quite different from what I usually do. it&amp;rsquo;s more vulnerable and having less time to think. Need to enter when chance come and get out when wrong immediately. Yellow line shows where I get in and out. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious not right to hold so long during day trading and no operation when finding enter the wrong position.</description>
